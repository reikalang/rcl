Reika Configuration Language

## Implementation

- [Go](impl/rcl-go)
- [Java](impl/rcl-j)

## About

RCL is [created](https://github.com/at15/reika/issues/49) 
because [xephonhq/awesome-time-series-database](https://github.com/xephonhq/awesome-time-series-database) 
needs a configuration language that can point out which line is wrong. 
It will be merged into Reika sometime in the future.

Reika is a character in animation [Raxephon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RahXephon).
The language is created as a DSL for time series database as course projects for UCSC CMPS 203 and CMPS 253.
It was originally in [xephonhq/tsdb-proxy-java/ql](https://github.com/xephonhq/tsdb-proxy-java/tree/master/ql),
later moved to [at15/reika](https://github.com/at15/reika) and now under [reikalang](https://github.com/reikalang).
