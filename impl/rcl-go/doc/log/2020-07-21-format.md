# 2020-07-21 Format

## Background

One goal for RCL is able to format the code while preserving the comment.

## Design

We can do it similar to go

- parser does not throw comment away
- attach comment to ast
- keep standalone comment out (i.e. not attach to any node)
- print ast out, adjust indentation and space

I find go is using position information of original AST, I might skip that use some fixed rules and discard old position entirely.
